My name is Ronak. And i love travelling. 
There was a huge tiger in an enclosure. He was playing with his little cubs. The boy took a lot of photos of the tiger. 
There were monkeys jumping on trees. He gave the monkeys a lot of bananas. He enjoyed there. 
There is a small boy in the village. He went with his family to the city for a holiday. there he visits a zoo. Over there there are many animals. he saw 2 crocodiles playing in the water. The zoo keeper told them that these 2 were in love and best friends.
